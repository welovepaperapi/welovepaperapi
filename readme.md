Hey there!
I’m WeLovePaperAPI, a Game Developer based in Austria.

I code and publish whatever I can imagine.


If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll code it.


My main tech stack is C++, Java, HTML, and Lua. My favorite tools are CLion, IntelliJ IDEA, and VSCode.


I’ve got a bunch of projects, but my main project is PolixerRPG.


I’ve built over 100 private repos, but publicly, it’s probably less than 20 at this point.


Fun Facts:
Oregairu is my favorite anime
Hobbies: anime, soccer
